project name:VULNERABILITY SCANNING TOOL
Python Implementation
Prerequisites
You need to install the following Python libraries:

socket: For network connections.
requests: For web-based checks.
subprocess: For running external commands (like nmap for port scanning).
os: For interacting with the operating system.
Explanation
Open Port Scanning:

The scan_open_ports method uses Python's socket library to check if common ports (like 21, 22, 80, etc.) are open on the target machine.
Outdated Software Check:

The check_outdated_software method runs a command (apt list --upgradable) on Linux-based systems to find outdated software packages. This is a simple example and can be extended to other operating systems.
Web Vulnerability Scanning:

The scan_web_vulnerabilities method uses the requests library to check if the target web server is missing important security headers (e.g., X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy). It also checks for the presence of the Server header, which can reveal the web server software and version.
Scan Execution:

The scan method runs all the scans and compiles the results into a report.
Usage
Replace 'example.com' with your target domain or IP address and run the script. The tool will output a report containing the open ports, outdated software, and potential web vulnerabilities.

Notes and Extensions
This is a basic vulnerability scanner and should be used responsibly on networks or websites you have permission to scan.
For more advanced scanning, consider integrating tools like nmap for comprehensive port scanning, or using libraries like OWASP ZAP for web vulnerabilities.
You can extend the check_outdated_software method to support different operating systems or package managers.
